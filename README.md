# My Passworder
**A Java application that helps create complicated and flexible passwords**
## Key Concepts:
- **PassPhrases**: A phrase (concept) that represents a part in the password. Like: the year of birth, the brand of my first car, etc.
- **PassPhrase Groups**: A group of PassPhrases. 
- **Password Structure**: Use groups of PassPhrases to from a complicated yet rememberable password.

## What is used:
- **Java Swing**: My first Swing application. A lot to improve.
- **SQLite**: An efficient way to manipulate small amount of data.

## Furture Improvement:
- Well, Documentation
- Improve Password Structure Editor. (GridBagLayout is not that easy to use)
- Start the application at one click.
